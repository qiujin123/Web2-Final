                <p>Come meet fellow summoners who also like video games and League of Legends. Cosplay as one of your
                    favorite in
                    game character and show it off to other gamers. Meet new friends who have similar interest and
                    passion and maybe
                    queue up next time in a rank game and if luck are with you, just maybe you can finally climb out of

                    community, it ainâ€™t
                    that toxic right?</p>
