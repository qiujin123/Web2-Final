    <h2>OPENING CEREMONY</h2>

    <p>In 2017, Adam Mackasek helped summon a dragon in Beijing. During the annual League of Legends World Championships
        at the 80,000-seat Beijing National Stadium. But this year we are going even bigger on our stage setup. Powered
        by a technology called 3D Holonet, created by a company called Kaleida. The Holonet allows us to do different
        types of effects that weren’t necessarily possible with augmented reality technology. This year the 3 sound are
        going to be “Giants” by True Damage, featuring Becky G, Soyeon, Thutmose, Duckwrth and Keke Palmer. “Awaken” by
        Valerie Broussard and the 2019 World song “Phoenix” by Cailin Russo and Chrissy Costanza. </p>
